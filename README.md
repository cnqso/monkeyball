A Next.js application for managing Super Monkey Ball tournaments with monkey distribution and congress management.

A weekend project. [Check it out here](https://monkeyball-sand.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Congress Management**: Create and manage tournament congresses
- **Live Rounds**: Create live rounds that can be finished later with scores
- **Player Management**: Add players with custom monkey assignments and profile pictures
- **Cool Design**: At least I think so

npm install
npm run dev
```
